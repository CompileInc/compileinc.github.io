# Portfolio powered by github API

Source code for the code portfolio on github powered by github API.

If you want your own portfolio, fork the project and change the `github_username` in nuxt.config.json and change the repo-name appropriately as mentioned [here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
